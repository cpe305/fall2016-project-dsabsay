You can then record yourself performing the rhythms using the microphone in your computer. You can perform the rhythm by clapping, snapping, tapping a pencil on a desk, or doing anything else that produces distinct attacks. RhythmTrainer will then grade your performance and give you a score.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* JavaFX\r\n* Music notation is rendered with VexFlow (https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow) and VexTab (https://github.com/0xfe/vextab).\r\n* The open-source (AGPL-3.0) Essentia library is used for the audio analysis. More information about Essentia can be found here: http://essentia.upf.edu\r\n",
